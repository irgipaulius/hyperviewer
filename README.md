# Hyper Viewer

**Review footage instantly, choose highlights, and export only what you need in full quality.**

Professional video processing toolkit for Nextcloud. Automatically generates HLS streams for smooth remote video review, then extract and download specific clips in original quality without re-encoding. Stop downloading entire 50GB files just to get a 30-second segment - review remotely, clip precisely, export losslessly. Perfect for videographers managing large footage libraries.

## Requirements

- Nextcloud 30+
- PHP 8.1+
- FFmpeg installed on server
- Sufficient disk space for HLS cache files

## Development

### Building (Webpack - Current)
```bash
npm install
NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider" npm run build
```

### Building (Vite - Faster Alternative)
```bash
npm install
npm run build:vite
```

### Watch Mode
```bash
npm run watch          # Webpack
npm run watch:vite     # Vite
```

### Code Quality
```bash
composer install                # Install PHP tools
composer cs:check               # Check code style
composer cs:fix                 # Fix code style
composer psalm                  # Static analysis
composer test:unit              # Run tests
```

## Configuration

In Nextcloud, navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Personal ‚Üí Hyper Viewer** to:
- Configure HLS cache location
- Monitor active FFmpeg jobs with real-time progress
- Manage auto-generation directories
- View job statistics

## How It Works

### HLS Streaming
1. Right-click any MOV/MP4 file ‚Üí **Generate HLS Cache**
   > alternatively, right-click a directory which recursively generates HLS cache for all MOV/MP4 files in it
2. Select quality variants (720p, 480p, 360p, 240p)
3. FFmpeg generates adaptive HLS stream in background
4. Click your gigantic MOV/MP4 file and enjoy HLS video stream within just a second!
5. Video seeks, quality switching, and mobile playback all supported

### Video Clipping & Export
1. Open any video file in the HLS player
2. Use the timeline to find your desired start and end points
3. Click **Export Clip** to extract just that segment
4. Original quality export using lossless stream copy (no re-encoding)
5. Download only the clip you need - not the entire 50GB file!
