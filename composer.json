Hyper Viewer brings powerful remote video clipping directly into your Nextcloud Files app.

When you find the perfect moment, open the clipping tool and export only the selected segment in full original quality. No re-encoding, no quality loss, no wasted data.

Perfect for:
✅ Cinematographers

✅ YouTubers & content creators
✅ Anyone managing large video archives
